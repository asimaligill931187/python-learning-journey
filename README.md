# python-learning-journey
This repository contains a series of Python projects I created while learning programming, data analysis, and AI concepts.   Each project focuses on building a solid understanding of Python fundamentals and applying them to real-world tasks.
# üêç Python Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python mini-projects I developed while learning programming fundamentals.  
Each project focuses on improving my understanding of Python syntax, data structures, functions, loops, and problem-solving.  

These projects represent my early journey in programming and demonstrate my logical thinking and coding discipline as I prepare for advanced studies in **Artificial Intelligence**.

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

Hi, I'm **Aqib Javed**, a Software Engineering graduate passionate about **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Python programming**.  
I built these projects while mastering Python basics and exploring how fundamental coding principles apply to data analysis and AI systems.  

I'm currently applying for **MS in Artificial Intelligence (Germany)** and using this repository to demonstrate my consistent learning and coding practice.
